"""Basic idea is to explore Python language;
learn its library and their usage;
practical applications and data science features;
practice machine learning algorithms;
apply ML techniques to obtain visualization;
apply ML techniques to provide recommendations;
that's all for now;
hope to explore more and learn more;
Python journey starts here"""
